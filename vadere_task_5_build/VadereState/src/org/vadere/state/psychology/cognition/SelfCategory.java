/**
 * According to the self-categorization theory ("reicher-2010"), people define
 * themselves as a member of social categories. People can have multiple
 * categories, e.g., father, football fan, colleague. At a specific point in
 * time, only one category is salient.
 *
 * Our agents use these categorizations to derive a specific behavior.
 * E.g., if an agents is "COOPERATIVE" (category), the pedestrian swaps places
 * (behavior) with other "COOPERATIVE" pedestrians (only if both feel committed
 * to this category as in-group member, see {@Å‚ink GroupMembership}.
 *
 * Usually, the self category of an agent changes during a simulation.
